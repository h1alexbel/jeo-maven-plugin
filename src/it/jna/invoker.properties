# @todo #824:30min Use 'full' profile for integration tests in JNA invoker
#  This test is currently using the 'short' profile, which excludes 'phi/unphi'
#  transformations since they take too long to run.
#  Here is the detailed explanation of the problem:
#  - https://github.com/objectionary/eo/issues/3257
#  When the issue is fixed, use the 'full' profile instead of 'short'.
#  Just to compare, the 'short' path takes 13 seconds to run, while the 'full' path
#  takes 31 minutes.
