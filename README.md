**jeo** stands for "Java EOlang Optimizations". **jeo-maven-plugin** is a Maven
plugin dedicated to optimizing Java bytecode. The process involves translating
the Java bytecode into the [EOlang](https://github.com/objectionary/eo)
programming language. Utilizing the optimization steps provided by EOlang, the
original code undergoes an enhancement process. Upon completion, the optimized
EOlang program is translated back to Java bytecode, achieving efficient and
optimized performance.
